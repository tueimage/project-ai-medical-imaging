## 1. Course Overview
The course consists of two types of assignments with distinct goals:

* **Assignments 1 & 2 (Skill Building):** You will learn foundational concepts including Transformers, GPT architectures, and Vision-Language models through structured tasks.
* **Open Project (Application):** You will apply this accumulated knowledge in an open setting to design experiments and answer a specific research question.

### Course Files

There are four files that contain all instructions for the course:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| README.md | The file that you are reading now, containing course information, logistics and guidelines |
| assignment_1_GPT.ipynb | Jupyter notebook for Assignment 1 focusing on GPT language models |
| assignment_2_VLM.ipynb | Jupyter notebook for Assignment 2 focusing on vision-language models |
| open_assignment.md | Instructions for the open-ended project component of the course |

Detailed instructions, theory questions, and code skeletons are provided directly within the Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, there are links to videos, papers and other recommended reading materials that you will find helpful in your work. 

We will also use Canvas for communication and assignment submission. 

## 2. Logistics & Teaching Methods

### Workload
The course is worth 5 ECTS. You are expected to spend **28 hours per ECTS** (140 hours total) on preparation and assignment work.

### Flipped Classroom Model
This is a **project-based course**. You are expected to work independently and proactively within your groups. We do not provide step-by-step instructions; you must navigate technical challenges and make methodological decisions under the guidance of TAs and instructors.

The course has one kick-off meeting and five lectures. The lectures are in a **flipped classroom** setting. In this course, "flipped Classroom" means you read the papers and other materials, and watch the videos at home as a **preparation for the lecture**. During the lecture, you actively discuss questions and topics about the material with other groups. You do not sit and listen to a lecture.

### Work in Groups
All assignments are performed in groups of 4 students via self-assignment in Canvas. Groups are divided into two sets (**Odd-numbered groups** and **Even-numbered groups**) with rotating roles:

* **Clients:** Responsible for identifying gaps in understanding. Prepare theory and coding/implementation questions to pose to Consultants.
* **Consultants:** Support the discussion. Review material beforehand to brainstorm, answer Client questions, and exchange resources.

### Conflict Resolution & Individual Grading
Professional collaboration within the groups is expected. If significant imbalance occurs, approach the TA/instructor immediately. Upon request, a formal peer review will assess individual contributions, potentially resulting in individual grades for students differing from the group average.

| **Exam week 2** | | Open assignment deadline | | |

### Weeks 2-5 lecture structure

Each flipped lecture follows a structured **Peer Consultancy** model designed to resolve specific blockers and deepen theoretical understanding.

**Introduction (10 min.)**

**Part 1: The Consultancy (35 min)**
* **Pair Up:** One **Client** group pairs with one **Consultant** group.
* **Discussion:**
    * Clients present their prepared questions or coding/implementation blockers.
    * Consultants use their prepared notes to brainstorm solutions, explain concepts, or point to specific resources.
* **The "Unsolvables":** If the paired groups cannot agree on an answer or solve a specific error, they must write this down as a "Priority Question."

**Part 2: Plenary Synthesis (45 min)**
* **Escalation:** The instructor collects the "Priority Questions" identified in Part 1.
* **Expert Review:** The instructor addresses these high-level blockers, clarifies common misconceptions, and provides deep-dive explanations on the most difficult theoretical concepts encountered during the week.

### Week 6 lecture structure (The Pitches)
The pitch session follows a structured **Formative Review** model designed to validate research questions and methodological plans before deep work begins.

**Introduction (10 min.)**

**Part 1: The Pitch Rounds (70 min)**
* **The Stage:** Groups present sequentially using the slides compiled on the instructor's computer.
* **Process:**
    * **Pitch (2 min):** The group presents their single slide outlining the research question and proposed methodology.
    * **Feedback (3-5 min):** Instructors and peers act as "critical friends" to identify scope risks, suggest simplifications, or confirm feasibility.
* **Strict Timing:** A hard stop is enforced to ensure every group receives equal feedback time.

**Part 2: Synthesis & Next Steps (10 min)**
* **Green Light:** Instructors confirm which projects are approved to proceed and which require a revision.
* **Common Patterns:** A summary of recurring issues observed across the pitches to guide the final project phase.

## 4. Deliverables & Submission

### For Assignments 1 and 2
1.  **Exercises:** Complete answers to the practical exercises.
2.  **Flipped Classroom Log:** A log of the preparation and participation in the flipped classroom.

ℹ️ *Both of these can be filled at the end of the Jupyter notebook and you can submit that in Canvas.*

### For the Open Project
* **Scientific Poster:** A single-page PDF summarizing research questions, experiments, and results.

### Submission Mechanics
Submit one set of deliverables per group via Canvas. Punctual submissions are expected, though small delays for valid technical issues (e.g., code crashes) are not penalized. Inform instructors immediately of significant delays.

## 5. Grading
The final course grade is based on three components:
* **Assignment 1:** 25%
* **Assignment 2:** 25%
* **Open Project:** 50%

### Assessment Rubric for Assignments 1 & 2

| Component | Insufficient | Satisfactory | Excellent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Understanding (Theory)** | Descriptions of methods are copied/pasted or incorrect; fails to convey understanding. | Descriptions are written in own words and show good understanding of the material. | Demonstrates mastery of the material; makes insightful connections between different methods or theories. |
| **Code Quality** | Code crashes or has errors; lack of documentation; unstructured "spaghetti code." | Code is self-contained and runs without errors; basic documentation provided; easy to reproduce results. | Code is user-friendly, modular, and well-structured; detailed documentation; optimized for performance. |
| **Results & Analysis** | Plots/Results are missing, mislabeled, or confusing; no analysis provided. | Clear plots with captions; correctly interpreted results (e.g., loss curves). | Professional visualizations; insightful analysis of why the model behaved that way (e.g., overfitting signs). |
| **Flipped Classroom Logs** | Logs are missing, incomplete, or trivial (e.g., one-word answers). | Logs are complete and clearly document the questions asked as Client and resources/advice shared as Consultant. | Logs demonstrate deep engagement; questions were insightful and Consultant contributions added significant value. |

### Assessment Rubric for the Open Project
